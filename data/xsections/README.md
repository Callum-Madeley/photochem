# Cross Section Data

This directory contains cross section data for photolysis reactions. If you update cross sections or quantum yields, also update `xs_metadata.yaml` with corresponding citations. Check for consistency between the `xs_metadata.yaml` and the data files by running `python xs_tools.py`.
