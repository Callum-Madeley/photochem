- *NO* I used Phidrates database. Eventually I should use the polynomial fit thing.
- *C4H2* xs is 2 times C2H2 xs.
- *HSO* set to HO2. Kevin says "HSO is more stable than HO2, but, you know, photolysis never really matters for these short-lived species"
- *HNO*. Kevin uses a constant photolysis rate. I'm going to omit it for now.
- *HNO2*. Kevin uses a constant photolysis rate. I'm going to omit it for now.
- *S8L*. Estimate for cross section of linear S8 chains in visible. set equal to S8R in uv
- *CH3OH*. CH3OH + hv  => CH3O +  H  this branch is reported 86Â±10%. The other processes are undetected
- *CH3CN*. CH3CN + HV  -> CH3 +  CN     ! the H + CH2CN is in fact somewhat more important
