Problem with PhotochemPy
- So much global data. Need to split globals into multiple modules, and pass more data to subroutines
- xsections suck
- mysterious if statements
- haze particles
- crumbly foundation in general
- not generalized




general notes
- we need a routine which checks for non-linearities in short-lived species. If there are non-linearities, then stop the program.
